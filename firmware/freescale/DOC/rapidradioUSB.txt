Module "Led"       (bean BitIO)
   - Led_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Led_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Led_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Led_NegVal -Negates (inverts) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(!GetVal())]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "SPI"       (bean SynchroMaster)
   - SPI_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data).   For information about SW overrun behavior please see <General info page>. [ Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on selected CPU and 
                receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Status of the 
                DMA transfer can then be checked using method GetCharsInRxBuf. See typical usage for details about 
                communication using DMA.
   - SPI_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA 
                mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA 
                controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. The status of the DMA transfer can then be 
                checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See the typical usage for details about communication using DMA.

Module "USB"       (bean Init_USB_HCS08)
   - USB_Init -This method initializes registers of the USB module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "CSN"       (bean BitIO)
   - CSN_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - CSN_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - CSN_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - CSN_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "RfmIrq"    (bean ExtInt)
   - RfmIrq_GetVal -Returns the actual value of the input pin of the component.

Module "TI1"       (bean TimerInt)
   - TI1_EnableEvent -This method enables the events.
   - TI1_DisableEvent -This method disables the events.

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC9S08JS16_20)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
